/** Provides utilities for working with streams concurrently. */
object concurrent {

  /**
    * Nondeterministically merges a stream of streams (`outer`) in to a single stream,
    * opening at most `maxOpen` streams at any point in time.
    *
    * The outer stream is evaluated and each resulting inner stream is run concurrently,
    * up to `maxOpen` stream. Once this limit is reached, evaluation of the outer stream
    * is paused until one or more inner streams finish evaluating.
    *
    * When the outer stream stops gracefully, all inner streams continue to run,
    * resulting in a stream that will stop when all inner streams finish
    * their evaluation.
    *
    * When the outer stream fails, evaluation of all inner streams is interrupted
    * and the resulting stream will fail with same failure.
    *
    * When any of the inner streams fail, then the outer stream and all other inner
    * streams are interrupted, resulting in stream that fails with the error of the
    * stream that cased initial failure.
    *
    * Finalizers on each inner stream are run at the end of the inner stream,
    * concurrently with other stream computations.
    *
    * Finalizers on the outer stream are run after all inner streams have been pulled
    * from the outer stream -- hence, finalizers on the outer stream will likely run
    * BEFORE the LAST finalizer on the last inner stream.
    *
    * Finalizers on the returned stream are run after the outer stream has finished
    * and all open inner streams have finished.
    *
    * @param maxOpen    Maximum number of open inner streams at any time. Must be > 0.
    * @param outer      Stream of streams to join.
